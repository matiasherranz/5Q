"Is there a Church in Your House?",11,1, "&lt;p&gt;Is there a church in this house? Are parents, children, and friends all members of it, or are some still unconverted? Let us pause here and let the question go round: Am I a member of the church in this house?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The father's heart would leap for joy, and the mother's eyes would fill with holy tears if from the eldest to the youngest all were saved! Let us pray for this great mercy until the Lord shall grant it to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably it had been the dearest object of Philemon's desires to have all his household saved; but it was not at first fully granted to him. He had a wicked servant, Onesimus, who, having wronged him, ran away from his service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His master's prayers followed him, and at last, as God would have it, Onesimus was led to hear Paul preach; his heart was touched, and he returned to Philemon not only to be a faithful servant, but a beloved brother, adding another member to the church in Philemon's house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there an unconverted family member absent this morning? Make special supplication that they may, upon returning to their home, gladden every heart with good news of what grace has done! Is there an unconverted family member still at home? Ask God to save him also.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is such a church in our house, let us order it well, and let everyone conduct themselves as in the sight of God. Let us go about our daily routines with studied holiness, diligence, kindness, and integrity. More is expected of a church than of an ordinary household.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family worship must, in such a case, be more devout and hearty; internal love must be warmer and unbroken, and external conduct must be more sanctified and Christlike. We need not fear that the smallness of our number will put us out of the list of churches, for the Holy Spirit has enrolled a family-church here in the inspired book of remembrance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a church let us now draw near to the great Head of the one Church universal, and let us beseech Him to give us grace to shine before men to the glory of His name.&lt;/p&gt;"
"Unchangeable",22,2,"&lt;p&gt;It is just as well for us that in all the variableness of life there is One whom change cannot affect, One whose heart can never alter, and on whose brow inconsistency can make no furrows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All other things have changed-all things are changing. The sun grows dim with age; the world is growing old; the final chapter of the worn-out vesture has begun; the heavens and earth must soon pass away; they will perish-they shall grow old like a garment. But there is One who only has immortality, of whose years there is no end, and in whose person there is no change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delight that the sailor feels when, having been tossed about on the waves, he steps again upon the solid shore is the satisfaction of a Christian when, in all the changes of this distressing life, he rests the foot of his faith upon this truth-'I the LORD do not change.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stability that the anchor gives the ship when it has at last obtained a solid hold is like that which the Christian's hope provides him when it fixes itself upon this glorious truth. With God 'there is no variation or shadow due to change.'&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever His attributes were in the past, they are now; His power, His wisdom, His justice, His truth are unchanged. He has forever been the refuge of His people, their stronghold in the day of trouble, and He is still their sure Helper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is unchanged in His love. He has loved His people with 'an everlasting love';&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; He loves them now as much as ever He did, and when the creation itself is set free from its bondage to decay, His love will still endure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Precious is the assurance that He does not change! The wheel of providence revolves, but its axle is eternal love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Death and change are busy ever,&lt;br&gt;Man decays, and ages move;&lt;br&gt;But His mercy waneth never;&lt;br&gt;God is wisdom, God is love.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; James 1:17 &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Jeremiah 31:3&lt;/p&gt;"
"Immediately Heard",11,3,"&lt;p&gt;Prayers are instantly noticed in heaven. The moment Saul began to pray, the Lord heard him. Here is comfort for the distressed but praying soul. When our hearts are broken and we bow in prayer, we are often only able to employ the language of sighs and tears; still our groaning has made all the harps of heaven thrill with music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That tear has been caught by God and treasured in the receptacle of heaven. 'Put my tears in your bottle'&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; implies that they are caught as they flow. The petitioner, whose fears prevent his words, will be well understood by the Most High. He may only look up with misty eye; but 'prayer is the falling of a tear.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tears are the diamonds of heaven; sighs are a part of the music of Jehovah's court and are numbered with 'the sublimest strains that reach the majesty on high.' Do not think that your prayer, however weak or trembling, will be unregarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacob's ladder is lofty, but our prayers shall lean upon the Angel of the covenant and so climb its starry rounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our God not only hears prayer but also loves to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He does not forget the cry of the humble. True, He does not regard high looks and lofty words; He does not care for the pomp and pageantry of kings; He does not listen to the drums of war; He does not regard the triumph and pride of man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But wherever there is a heart enlarged with sorrow or a lip quivering with agony or a deep groan or a penitential sigh, the heart of Jehovah is open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He marks it down in the registry of His memory; He puts our prayers, like rose leaves, between the pages of His book of remembrance, and when at last the volume is opened, there will be a precious fragrance springing from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Faith asks no signal from the skies,&lt;br&gt;To show that prayers accepted rise.&lt;br&gt;Our Priest is in His holy place,&lt;br&gt;And answers from the throne of grace.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Psalm 56:8&lt;/p&gt;"
